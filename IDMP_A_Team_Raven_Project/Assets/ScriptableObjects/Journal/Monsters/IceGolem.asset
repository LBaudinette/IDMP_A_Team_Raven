  monsterDescription: '<i>Fighting in the slowing area created by the Ice Golems
    attack spells death for those who wish to defeat it.</i>



    <i>Ice golems
    are large constructs made of ice, given life with arcane magic. They are often
    used by clerics or druids serving winter deities, and most often used in lands
    that never truly melt -- the cost and difficulty involved in crafting them would
    go to waste if the creature just turned to slush in the morning.</i>'
