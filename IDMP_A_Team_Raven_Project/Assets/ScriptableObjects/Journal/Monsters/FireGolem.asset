  monsterDescription: '<i>Slow but purposeful. Quick and careful movement is the
    key to defeating the Fire Golem.</i>



    <i>It is believed that all life was
    forged when fire, earth, iron and flesh were combined. A Necromancer learned
    in this art can summon a Golem constructed entirely from living flame. The Necromancer
    summons the Golem through accelerating particles of the air at an ever increasing
    pace.</i>'
